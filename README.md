Title:
'Matching Photos'

How the game works
There are 16 cards on a board and 8 matching pairs. Click on the cards to reveal icons and see if you got a match!

All cards are unvisible.

The player clicks chosen card and photo is visible.
The player cliks second chosen card - if visible photos are the same, pair is matched and stays visible.
If visible cards aren't the same then they become unvisible again.
Game finished when all 8 pairs are matched and all 16 photos are visible.

Once you get all 8 matches, the game is over and you will receive a star rating based on how well you did.
